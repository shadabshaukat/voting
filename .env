# QueuePool with pre_ping, recycle, LIFO helps with stability and burst handling.

DB_POOL_PRE_PING=true     # check connection health before use
DB_POOL_USE_LIFO=true     # reduce latency under bursts

# If using PgBouncer in transaction pooling mode, switch to NullPool (single server-side connection per transaction):
# DB_POOLCLASS=NullPool
# (with PgBouncer, pool sizing is managed by PgBouncer; keep PRE_PING=true)
